# Memory game

## Project
This is a working memory game, inspired by an assignment from LOI study. There are 3 different playing modes. Every time you click on a card a corresponding sound is played. Whenever you have a match, the cards become vague and unclickable. If every memory match is found, the game is finished and the timer stops. Your name and highscore are saved in local storage. 

## Built with:
- JavaScript
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid, CSS Flexbox

### Future improvements
- [ ] Turn sound on/off
- [ ] New/change player
- [ ] Mobile design
- [ ] Mobile friendly
